# Creating a Clean and Structured Audio Dataset in Various Indian Languages

**Data Sourcing:**

Source audio data from diverse outlets, including publicly available online databases, open-source datasets, crowdsourced repositories, and in-house recordings, ensuring representation of various Indian languages, dialects, and accents.

**Data Validation:**

Assess data quality and authenticity, ensuring clear, noise-free audio files in specified Indian languages. Remove irrelevant or corrupted recordings.

**Data Cleaning:**

Prepare audio data for machine learning by normalizing volume, segmenting long files, ensuring consistent formats and sampling rates, and labeling with corresponding Indian language, dialect, or accent.

**Labeling and Classification:**

Implement a structured labeling system, categorizing audio files by Indian language, dialect, and, if applicable, speaker gender, age, emotion, or sentiment. Ensure a well-balanced dataset.

**Deliverables:**

Provide a documented dataset with clean, preprocessed audio files, a description document outlining sources and processing, a labeling schema, and a brief report summarizing the work and challenges faced.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Evaluation will consider the quality and diversity of sourced data, accuracy in the validation process, effectiveness of data cleaning, and the organization and clarity of the final dataset.
